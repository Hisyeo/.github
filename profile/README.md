Welcome to the **HisyÃ«Ã¶ Institute**, the official organization that supports the development, publication, and proselytization of the HisyÃ«Ã¶ language and culture. We seek to grow a community of likeminded individuals around the world who participate in online and local HisyÃ«Ã¶ events that seek to be:

- Safe,
- Uplifting, and
- Cerebral

Join us if you would like to make a better world through a shared language and its community.
